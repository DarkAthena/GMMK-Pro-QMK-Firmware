# GMMK-Pro-QMK-Firmware
My custom QMK firmware for my GMMK Pro. keymap.c is heavily commented for non-coders.

I'm not a coder. I wish I were a coder, but I'm not. 
I got a GMMK Pro becuase I love mechanical keyboards and wanted to try a smaller sized board than my trusty TKL. I love my Pro. I don't love the Glorious software that they have for it. It's not Glorious. 

QMK seemed pretty awesome. I used the Configurater with no problems...except the RGB lighting didn't work. Okay. How hard can it be to add that? 

For a non-coder, it was hard. So hard. I was ready to hire someone to just write the dang file already. Then, I went to the QMK Discord and found some help.

I'm uploading my custom file here, commented so you can see what each part does. It's not perfect, but it works how I want it to work. It should be relatively simple to make some basic changes. There's nothing fancy in there, so that you'll have to figure out on your own (I recommend the QMK Discord).

HUGE THANKS to elpeke√±in and Dasky for their help making this file and explaining what all the code means. I didn't understand all of it, but I accepted their knowledge. 

Good luck!
